## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
We have used

Bayesian Ridge,
Kernal Ridge,
Gradient Boosting 
for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of models are:-

Bayesian Ridge --> 77.04498657347912    
Kernal Ridge --> 106.81986414973701    
Gradient Boosting --> 38.20427011859272
## RMSE value of best model is 38.204 by Gradient Boosting
